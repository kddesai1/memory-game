## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   NONE

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
    
    A challenge I encountered while creating this submission was adding images to the buttons when clicked. At first, I tried to make an image appear on top of the button when it was clicked.
    I had difficulty implementing this feature. I looked to sources online and found some guidance, but they were all very complicated. 
    For a simple assignment like this one, I wanted to find an easier way to implement this feature. 
    I went back to read the directions for section 5 on “Sprucing up your buttons.” I realized that all I needed to do was 
    change the background of the button to whatever I wanted when the button is being clicked. 
    This was much simpler and got the job done well.  


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
    I ran into a couple issues while working on this project and I tried my best to debug. 
    If I could not figure out how to fix the issue I would have to completely change my approach. 
    This works but it is not ideal. Additionally, what are some tips for writing efficient code? 
    When I was writing my code I found multiple ways to implement my code, but I tried my best to implement the most efficient method. 
    However, there is definitely room for improvement and I would love some tips. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would try to implement the remaining optional features, such as a timer and using more complex sounds. 
   I would also like to spend some time working on the aesthetics of my app. 
   Additionally, I think it would be interesting to implement an advanced version of this game in which the player must guess an entire pattern in one turn 
   (as opposed to the current version of the player guessing one additional clue each turn). 
   Each round the player guesses correctly they receive one point. This continues until they make a mistake. 
   The high score will be recorded. Then the player can start over and try to beat this score.
